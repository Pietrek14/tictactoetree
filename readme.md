# TicTacToe Tree

This is my homework for IT lessons. Our task was to implement a tree in which we would place all tic-tac-toe boards that could happen after a given position and find the fastest way to achieve a victory of either side.

## Make

- **make / make build** - compiles the project into the **build** directory
- **make run** - runs the project
