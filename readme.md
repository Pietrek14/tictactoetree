# TicTacToe Tree

This is my homework for IT lessons. Our task was to implement a tree in which we would place all tic-tac-toe boards that could happen after a given position and find the fastest way to achieve a victory of either side.

## Make

- **make / make build** - compiles the project into the **build** directory
- **make run** - runs the project

## Input

The program will ask you for a board code. A board code is just a 9 characters long string containing the rows of the board. The only valid characters in a board code are "X", "O" and " " (a space, for an empty field). After inputing the board code, the program will execute using the given board as the starting point for the algorithm.
